<h4>Steps to Run:</h4>
  Run the App.java file to launch the application
  New tabs can be added and closed
  The left panel icons can be dragged to place on the right panelâ€™s current tab
  Each icon can be treated as a input/output button.
  An input button cannot be linked to another input button and same goes with output buttons
  To draw a line, click on one icon and click on the second icon.
  Compile will show a pop-up that displays a generated digraph code.
  Save/Load enables the user to save the current tab as a file and load the saved graph in a new tab.

Install Graphviz or run the following command to generate a png diagram.
dot -Tpng graph.txt -o graph.png

graph.txt will be inputted with the generated code. The png diagram will generate the same graph as the tabs of the application.
 
The above project is an attempt to mimic Astah where we can generate class diagrams from a given code.
